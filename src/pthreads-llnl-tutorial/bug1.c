/******************************************************************************
* FILE: bug1.c
* DESCRIPTION:
*   This example has a bug. It is a variation on the condvar.c example. 
*   Instead of just one thread waiting for the condition signal, there are
*   four threads waiting for the same signal. Find out how to fix the
*   program. The solution program is bug1fix.c.
* SOURCE: Adapted from example code in "Pthreads Programming", B. Nichols
*   et al. O'Reilly and Associates.
* LAST REVISED: 07/06/05  Blaise Barney
