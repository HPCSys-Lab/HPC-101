ulimit [-SHacdflmnpstuv [limit]]

 Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on sys-
 tems that allow such control.  The -H and -S options specify that the hard or soft  limit  is  set
 for  the  given  resource.   A  hard limit cannot be increased once it is set; a soft limit may be
 increased up to the value of the hard limit.  If neither -H nor -S is specified, both the soft and
 hard limits are set.  The value of limit can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or
 one of the special values hard, soft, or unlimited, which stand for the current  hard  limit,  the
 current  soft  limit,  and  no limit, respectively.  If limit is omitted, the current value of the
 soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the -H option is given.  When more than one resource
 is specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the value.  Other options are interpreted
 as follows:

       -a     All current limits are reported
       -c     The maximum size of core files created
       -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment
       -f     The maximum size of files created by the shell
       -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
       -m     The maximum resident set size
       -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be set)
       -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
       -s     The maximum stack size
       -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
       -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user
       -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell

 If  limit is given, it is the new value of the specified resource (the -a option is display only).
 If no option is given, then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte  increments,  except  for  -t,
 which  is  in seconds, -p, which is in units of 512-byte blocks, and -n and -u, which are unscaled
 values.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument  is  supplied,  or  an  error
 occurs while setting a new limit.
