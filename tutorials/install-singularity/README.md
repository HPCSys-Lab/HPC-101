# Install Singularity

In order to create singularity containers, you need to install singularity on your computer. We strongly recommend the use of Linux. If you do not have a Linux system, you can use the [Online Builder](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder) to create your containers.

For those who have Linux, you can try to run one of the script bellow (both scripts need root privileges):

- [install-singularity-debian.sh](https://github.com/HPCSys-Lab/HPC-101/blob/main/tutorials/install-singularity/install-singularity-debian.sh)

- [install-singularity-ubuntu.sh](https://github.com/HPCSys-Lab/HPC-101/blob/main/tutorials/install-singularity/install-singularity-ubuntu.sh)

After that, you can verify your installation with:

`singularity version`
